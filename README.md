# Producer-Consumer-Problem-Implementation
Given the size of a circular buffer and number of readers, write a code with n+1 threads, n for readers and 1 for the writers. All are accessing the same circular buffer. The following conditions should be satisfied: ■ A reader cannot read in an empty location. ■ A reader will not read from the same location twice if the writer has not overwritten. ■ A writer cannot overwrite a place which has not been read by every reader.
